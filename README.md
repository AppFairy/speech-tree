# Speech Tree

Speech Tree is a utility module which aims to provide you with advanced capabilities when it comes to speech recognition in addition to the natively provided [web-speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API).

Using Speech Tree you can:

- Register events for incoming speech based on its content.
- Register a sequence of events which should follow each other in a specific order.
- Analyze a sentence using user-defined methods.
- Label a sentence against the server using a user-defined classifier.
